Hi, Iâ€™m Francesco and I'm a 24 years old developer! 

I started my travel in the coding world when I was 13 out of curiosity and passion and I pushed myself to my limits to grow. 
I love challenging projects and this is why I always try to develop apps based on something that I like; it's easier to make something great if you actually love it!

On my Github you'll find some projects of mine, but of course not all of them. I'm always willing to learn and grow in this world since I know that my road to be the perfect developer ist still long.
But this isn't going to stop me from putting all my efforts in this job.
